# Ccwc
## Info
This is my own implementation of the word counter tool that exists in Unix systems. Given a text as an input parameter it will parse it and return soma info about this text. It is based on the guideline I found in this page [https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc].



## Examples (in terminal)
Displays help text.

```Ccwc --help```

Returns the the number of bytes in the input file.

```Ccwc -c ./Resources/test.txt```
